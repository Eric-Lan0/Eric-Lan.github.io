Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I am a PhD student at Purdue University. Contact me at lan44\[at\]purdue.edu

My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) Theory and Foundation Model (LLM and Diffusion Model) Post-Training -- Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) & Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Getting started
======
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
